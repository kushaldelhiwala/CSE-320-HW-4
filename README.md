# Homework 4

Don't cheat. Good luck!

Edit by Kushal: 

For my Homework 4, I have just one Makefile located in the root directory for all 3 coding portion of the HW. I have followed all the requirements in regards to executable and data structure names, except where it has not been specified (for part 3). I have three seperate folders for each part, named part_2, part_3, and part_4. To compile my code please do the following: 

Program 1, Part 2:
Proceed to the root directory (i.e. kdelhiwala@kushal:~/cse320/hw4-kdelhiwala). Once in the root directory, please type "make progfib". This will compile the code. To run it, please type "./hw4_progfib N", where N is the number you want to calculate the fibonacci of. Click enter. The result should be the fibonacci of the number you inputted (N). 

Program 2, Part 2: 
Proceed to the root directory (i.e. kdelhiwala@kushal:~/cse320/hw4-kdelhiwala). Once in the root directory, please type "make progcnt". This will compile the code. To run it, please type "./hw4_progcnt". Click enter. The result will be in the requested form as per the homework document. Note: Please ensure that the files are located in the root directory, and with the correct name. Otherwise, the program will throw an error. 

Program 3, Part 2: 



Part 3: 
Proceed to the root directory (i.e. kdelhiwala@kushal:~/cse320/hw4-kdelhiwala). Once in the root directory, please type "make prevhw" (note: we were not given a name, so this is what I chose). This will compile the code. To run it, please type "./hw4_prevhw". Click enter. This will prompt the shell. Once you are in the shell, please type any of the valid commands (help, hire, fire, fireall, list, exit) to test as you please. 

Part 4:
